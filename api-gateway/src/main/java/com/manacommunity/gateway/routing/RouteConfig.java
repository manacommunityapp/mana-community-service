 *   <li>Programmatic route customization that cannot be expressed in YAML</li>
 *   <li>Adding metadata to routes for Swagger/OpenAPI discovery</li>
 *   <li>Conditional routes that depend on runtime configuration</li>

 * finance, marketplace, food, healthcare, sports, events, security, visitor, booking,
 * notification, workflow, document, search, analytics, ai) with CircuitBreaker and
 * Retry filters configured per service.
